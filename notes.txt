Just some notes to help me remember certain things

help files find the proper path:
===================================
$LOAD_PATH.unshift File.expand_path('../', __FILE__)

============
As of now, I have a pretty good tic tac toe just human against human.
Now, I need to be able to add an option to play against the computer.
If I just take the option away for human against human, then I am taking
away functionality.  Therefore, if I just add the option:
1.  Human vs. Human
2.  Human vs. Computer

Then if I pick 2, it will just go to another method block and I don't have 
to change what is already working.
